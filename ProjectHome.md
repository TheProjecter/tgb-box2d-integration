This project provides a way of using **Box2D 2.0.1** in Garage Games' **Torque Game Builder**.

## Features ##
  * All of Box2D's classes are exposed to Torquescript
  * Box2D bodies and shapes can be bound to t2dSceneObject
  * Body and shape binding is supported in the TGB's scene editor through _Behaviors_

The wrapper originally was created in the course of writing my bachelor thesis. The thesis can be found here:
[Integrating Box2D into TGB 1.0.pdf](http://tgb-box2d-integration.googlecode.com/files/Integrating%20Box2D%20into%20TGB%201.0.pdf)

Please read the thesis to get an understanding of the general idea behind the wrapper. The thesis also contains instructions on compiling TGB and Box2D together and a short guide on setting up an example scene.

The wrapper has only been tested on Windows. It should also work on Mac but I've never had a chance to try that.

Please report any bugs you encounter on this page in the issue tracker.
